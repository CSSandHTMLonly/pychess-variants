Weâ€™re pleased to announce that Bughouse Chess, one of the most popular variant, now available to play on Pychess!

This is the result of almost three years of relentless coding work by [@blunderman1](https://www.pychess.org/@/blunderman1)

Bughouse was requested on lichess from the very beginning [here](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/issues/50) and [here](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/issues/1628), but it was denied because "The long-term complexity is probably just not worth it". Lichess users never gave up thogh, they wrote several petitions and later created the [lichess-bughouse](https://lichess.org/team/lichess-bughouse) team there. In light of this, it is impossible to appreciate enough what blunderman1 has achieved.
