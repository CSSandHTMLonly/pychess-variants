Shatranj is an old form of chess, as played in the Sasanian Empire. Its origins are in the Indian game of chaturanga. Modern chess gradually developed from this game, as it was introduced to Europe by contacts in Muslim Al-Andalus (modern Spain) and in Sicily in the 10th century.

## Rules

The general rules are extremely similar to Chess, so this guide will focus on the few differences. The objective is the same: checkmating your opponent's king.

* The pawns can't move two squares on the first move. When they reach the eighth rank, they are promoted to ferz.
* The king is always on the left side of the player regardless of color. Stalemates is loss for the stealmated player.
* Capturing all one's opponent's pieces apart from the king (baring the king) is win.
